Guido van Rossum (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɣido vɑn ˈrɔsʏm, -səm], born 31 January 1956) is a Dutch programmer best known as the author of the Python programming language, for which he is the "Benevolent Dictator For Life" (BDFL), which means he continues to oversee Python development, making decisions when necessary.[6] From 2005 to December 2012, he worked at Google, where he spent half of his time developing the Python language. In January 2013, he started working for Dropbox.[4]

Education and life[edit]
Van Rossum was born and raised in the Netherlands, where he received a master's degree in mathematics and computer science from the University of Amsterdam in 1982. He has a brother, Just van Rossum, who is a type designer and programmer who designed the typeface used in the "Python Powered" logo.[citation needed]
Guido lives in Belmont, California, with his wife, Kim Knapp,[7] and their son.[8][9][10] According to his home page, the "van" in his name is capitalized when he is referred to by surname alone, but not when using his first and last name together.[11]
Work[edit]
While working at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), Van Rossum wrote and contributed a glob() routine to BSD Unix in 1986[12][13] and helped develop the ABC programming language. He once stated, "I try to mention ABC's influence because I'm indebted to everything I learned during that project and to the people who worked on it."[14] He also created Grail, an early web browser written in Python, and engaged in discussions about the HTML standard.[15]
He has worked for various research institutes, including the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI).
Python[edit]

In December 1989, Van Rossum had been looking for a "'hobby' programming project that would keep [him] occupied during the week around Christmas" as his office was closed when he decided to write an interpreter for a "new scripting language [he] had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers". He attributes choosing the name "Python" to "being in a slightly irreverent mood (and [being] a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus)".[16]
He has explained that Python's predecessor, ABC, was inspired by SETL, noting that ABC co-developer Lambert Meertens had "spent a year with the SETL group at NYU before coming up with the final ABC design".[17]
Computer Programming for Everybody[edit]
In 1999, Van Rossum submitted a funding proposal to DARPA called Computer Programming for Everybody, in which he further defined his goals for Python:

An easy and intuitive language just as powerful as major competitors
Open source, so anyone can contribute to its development
Code that is as understandable as plain English
Suitability for everyday tasks, allowing for short development times

Python has grown to become a popular programming language. As of October 2017, it was the second most popular language on GitHub, a social coding website, behind Javascript and ahead of Java.[18] According to a programming language popularity survey[19] it is consistently amongst the top 10 most mentioned languages in job postings. Furthermore, Python is consistently[clarification needed] in the top 10 most popular languages according to the TIOBE Programming Community Index.[20]
Mondrian[edit]
Not to be confused with Mondrian (software), data visualisation software, or Mondrian OLAP server.
At Google, Van Rossum developed Mondrian, a web-based code review system written in Python and used within the company. He named the software after the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian.[21] He named another related software project after Gerrit Rietveld, a Dutch designer.[22]
Dropbox[edit]
In 2013, Van Rossum started working at the cloud file storage company Dropbox.[23]
Awards[edit]

At the 2002 FOSDEM conference in Brussels, Van Rossum received the 2001 Award for the Advancement of Free Software from the Free Software Foundation (FSF) for his work on Python.
In May 2003, he received a NLUUG Award.[24]
In 2006, he was recognized as a Distinguished Engineer by the Association for Computing Machinery.
In 2018, he was made Fellow of the Computer History museum.[25]
