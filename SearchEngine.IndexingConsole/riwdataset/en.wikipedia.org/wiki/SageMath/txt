SageMath (previously Sage or SAGE, "System for Algebra and Geometry Experimentation"[2]) is a computer algebra system with features covering many aspects of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, graph theory, numerical analysis, number theory, calculus and statistics.
The first version of SageMath was released on 24 February 2005 as free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2, with the initial goals of creating an "open source alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica, and MATLAB".[3] The originator and leader of the SageMath project, William Stein, is a mathematician at the University of Washington.
SageMath uses a syntax resembling Python's[4] supporting procedural, functional and object-oriented constructs.

Development[edit]




William A. Stein


William Stein realized when designing Sage that there were many open-source mathematics software packages already written in different languages, namely C, C++, Common Lisp, Fortran and Python.
Rather than reinventing the wheel, Sage (which is written mostly in Python and Cython) integrates many specialized mathematics software packages into a common interface, for which a user needs to know only Python. However, Sage contains hundreds of thousands of unique lines of code adding new functions and creating the interface between its components.[11]
SageMath uses both students and professionals for development. The development of SageMath is supported by both volunteer work and grants.[12] However, it was not until 2016 that the first full-time Sage developer was hired (funded by an EU grant).[13] The same year, Stein described his disappointment with a lack of academic funding and credentials for software development, citing it as the reason for his decision to leave his tenured academic position to work full-time on the project in a newly founded company, SageMath, Inc.[13]
Release history[edit]
Only the major releases are listed below. SageMath practices the "release early, release often" concept, with releases every few weeks or months. In total, there have been over 300 releases, although their frequency has decreased.[14]

2012: one of the projects selected for the Google Summer of Code.[18]
2013: ACM/SIGSAM Jenks Prize.[19]
SageMath has been cited in a variety of publications.[20][21]

Performance[edit]
Both binaries and source code are available for SageMath from the download page. If SageMath is built from source code, many of the included libraries such as ATLAS, FLINT, and NTL will be tuned and optimized for that computer, taking into account the number of processors, the size of their caches, whether there is hardware support for SSE instructions, etc.
Cython can increase the speed of SageMath programs, as the Python code is converted into C.[22]
Licensing and availability[edit]
SageMath is free software, distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3.[1] SageMath is available in many ways:

The source code can be downloaded from the downloads page. Although not recommended for end users, development releases of SageMath are also available. Many Linux distributions also include SageMath in their repositories [see below].
Binaries can be downloaded for Linux, macOS and Solaris (both x86 and SPARC).
A live CD containing a bootable Linux operating system is also available. This allows usage of SageMath without Linux installation.
Users could have used an online version of SageMath at sagenb.org[permanent dead link], but it has been discontinued in April 2015.
Users can use an online "single cell" version of SageMath at sagecell.sagemath.org or embed a single SageMath cell into any web page. Users can also create permalinks to SageMath computations using the cell server.[23]
A new online SageMath notebook is available at cocalc.com.

Full documentation for installation is provided at doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/.
Although Microsoft was sponsoring a native version of SageMath for the Windows operating system, prior to 2016 there were no plans for a native port, and users of Windows had to use virtualization technology such as VirtualBox to run SageMath.[24] As of SageMath 8.0 (July 2017), with development funded by the OpenDreamKit project[13], it successfully builds on Cygwin, and a binary installer for 64-bit versions of Windows is available.[25]
Linux distributions in which SageMath is available as a package are Mandriva, Fedora, Arch Linux, Debian and NixOS. It is also available as a dedicated Ubuntu PPA.[26] In Gentoo, it's available via layman in the "sage-on-gentoo"[27] overlay. However, SageMath can be installed to any Linux distribution.
Gentoo prefix also provides Sage on other operating systems.
Software packages contained in SageMath[edit]
The philosophy of SageMath is to use existing open-source libraries wherever they exist. Therefore, it uses many libraries from other projects.

Usage examples[edit]
Algebra and calculus[edit]


x, a, b, c = var('x, a, b, c')
# Note that IPython also supports a faster way to do this, by calling 
# this equivalent expression starting with a comma:
# ,var x a b c

log(sqrt(a)).simplify_log() # returns 1/2*log(a)
log(a / b).expand_log() # returns log(a) - log(b)
sin(a + b).simplify_trig() # returns sin(a)*cos(b) + sin(b)*cos(a)
cos(a + b).simplify_trig() # returns -sin(a)*sin(b) + cos(a)*cos(b)
(a + b)^5 # returns (a + b)^5
expand((a + b) ^ 5) # a^5 + 5*a^4*b + 10*a^3*b^2 + 10*a^2*b^3 + 5*a*b^4 + b^5

limit((x ^ 2 + 1) / (2 + x + 3 * x ^ 2), x=Infinity) # returns 1/3
limit(sin(x) / x, x=0) # returns 1

diff(acos(x), x) # returns -1/sqrt(-x^2 + 1)
f = exp(x) * log(x)
f.diff(x, 3) # returns e^x*log(x) + 3*e^x/x - 3*e^x/x^2 + 2*e^x/x^3

solve(a * x ^ 2 + b * x + c, x) # returns [x == -1/2*(b + sqrt(-4*a*c + b^2))/a, 
                                # x == -1/2*(b - sqrt(-4*a*c + b^2))/a]

f = x ^ 2 + 432 / x
solve(f.diff(x) == 0, x) # returns [x == 3*I*sqrt(3) - 3, 
                         # x == -3*I*sqrt(3) - 3, x == 6]

Differential equations[edit]


t = var('t') # define a variable t
x = function('x')(t) # define x to be a function of that variable
de = (diff(x, t) + x == 1)
desolve(de, [x, t]) # returns (c + e^t)*e^(-t)

Linear algebra[edit]


A = matrix([[1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1]])
y = vector([0, -4, -1])
A.solve_right(y) # returns (-2, 1, 0)
A.eigenvalues() # returns [5, 0, -1]

B = matrix([[1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 1]])
B.inverse() # returns
   [   0  1/2 -1/2]
   [-1/4 -1/4    1]
   [ 1/2    0 -1/2]

# same matrix, but over the ring of doubles (not rationals, as above)
sage: B = matrix(RDF, [[1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 1]])
sage: B.inverse()

[-5.55111512313e-17                0.5               -0.5]
[             -0.25              -0.25                1.0]
[               0.5                0.0               -0.5]

# Call NumPy for the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse, 
# since SageMath does not support that yet.

import numpy
C = matrix([[1 , 1], [2 , 2]])
matrix(numpy.linalg.pinv(C)) # returns
   [0.1 0.2]
   [0.1 0.2]

Number theory[edit]


prime_pi(1000000) # returns 78498, the number of primes less than one million

E = EllipticCurve('389a') # construct an elliptic curve from its Cremona label
P, Q = E.gens()
7 * P + Q # returns (24187731458439253/244328192262001 : 
          # 3778434777075334029261244/3819094217575529893001 : 1)



sage: E2 = EllipticCurve(CC, [0,0,-2,1,1])
sage: E2
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + (-2.00000000000000)*y = 
         x^3 + 1.00000000000000*x + 1.00000000000000 over 
         Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
