				You do not have permission to edit this page, for the following reasons:


Your IP address is in a range which has been blocked on all wikis.

The block was made by Vituzzu (meta.wikimedia.org).
The reason given is hosting service with open proxies such as 67.207.94.79 .

Start of block: 13:14, 23 October 2017
Expiration of block: 13:14, 23 October 2022

You can contact Vituzzu to discuss the block.
You cannot use the "Email this user" feature unless a valid email address is specified in your account preferences and you have not been blocked from using it.
Your current IP address is 67.207.88.228, and the blocked range is 67.207.64.0/19.
Please include all above details in any queries you make.


You are currently unable to edit Wikipedia.
You are still able to view pages, but you are not currently able to edit, move, or create them.




Editing from 67.207.64.0/19 has been blocked (disabled) by KrakatoaKatie for the following reason(s):




The IP address that you are currently using has been blocked  because it is believed to be a web host provider. To prevent abuse, web hosts may be blocked from editing Wikipedia.


You will not be able to edit Wikipedia using a web host provider.
Since the web host acts like a proxy, because it hides your IP address, it has been blocked. To prevent abuse, these IPs may be blocked from editing Wikipedia. If you do not have any other way to edit Wikipedia, you will need to request an IP block exemption.
If you do not believe you are using a web host, you may appeal this block by adding the following text on your talk page: {{unblock|reason=Caught by a web host block but this host or IP is not a web host. Place any further information here. ~~~~}}. If you are using a Wikipedia account you will need to request an IP block exemption by either using the unblock template or by submitting an appealing using the unblock ticket request system. If you wish to keep your IP address private you can email the functionaries team.
Administrators: The IP block exemption user right should only be applied to allow users to edit using web host in exceptional circumstances, and they should usually be directed to the functionaries team via email. If you intend to give the IPBE user right, a CheckUser needs to take a look at the account. This can be requested most easily at SPI Quick Checkuser Requests. Unblocking an IP or IP range with this template is highly discouraged without at least contacting the blocking administrator.

This block has been set to expire: 12:56, 12 August 2020.
Even if blocked, you will usually still be able to edit your user talk page and email other editors and administrators.

== Features and philosophy ==
Python is a [[multi-paradigm programming language]]. [[Object-oriented programming]] and [[structured programming]] are fully supported, and many of its features support [[functional programming]] and [[aspect-oriented programming]] (including by [[metaprogramming]]<ref name="AutoNT-13" /> and [[metaobject]]s (magic methods)).<ref name="AutoNT-14" /> Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including [[design by contract]]<ref name="AutoNT-15" /><ref name="AutoNT-16" /> and [[logic programming]].<ref name="AutoNT-17" />

Python uses [[dynamic typing]], and a combination of [[reference counting]] and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for [[memory management]]. It also features dynamic [[Name resolution (programming languages)|name resolution]] ([[late binding]]), which binds method and variable names during program execution.

Python's design offers some support for [[functional programming]] in the [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] tradition. It has <code>filter()</code>, <code>map()</code>, and <code>reduce()</code> functions; [[list comprehension]]s, [[Associative array|dictionaries]], and sets; and [[Generator (computer programming)|generator]] expressions.<ref name="AutoNT-59"/> The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[Standard ML]].<ref name="AutoNT-18" />

The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document ''The [[Zen of Python]]'' (''PEP 20''), which includes [[aphorism]]s such as:<ref name="PEP20" />
<!-- Note this isn't a full list, just some of the more significant aphorisms -->
* Beautiful is better than ugly
* Explicit is better than implicit
* Simple is better than complex
* Complex is better than complicated
* Readability counts

Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with [[ABC (programming language)|ABC]], which espoused the opposite approach.<ref name="venners-interview-pt-1" />

While offering choice in coding methodology, the Python philosophy rejects exuberant syntax (such as that of [[Perl]]) in favor of a simpler, less-cluttered grammar. As [[Alex Martelli]] put it: "To describe something as 'clever' is ''not'' considered a compliment in the Python culture."<ref name="AutoNT-19" /> Python's philosophy rejects the Perl "[[there is more than one way to do it]]" approach to language design in favor of "there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it".<ref name="PEP20" />

Python's developers strive to avoid [[premature optimization]], and reject patches to non-critical parts of CPython that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.<ref name="AutoNT-20" /> When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or use [[PyPy]], a [[just-in-time compilation|just-in-time compiler]]. [[Cython]] is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.

An important goal of Python's developers is keeping it fun to use. This is reflected in the language's name—a tribute to the British comedy group [[Monty Python]]<ref name="AutoNT-24"/>—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (from a [[Spam (Monty Python)|famous Monty Python sketch]]) instead of the standard [[Foobar|foo and bar]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://insidetech.monster.com/training/articles/8114-15-ways-python-is-a-powerful-force-on-the-web |title=15 Ways Python Is a Powerful Force on the Web}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.python.org/2/library/pprint.html |title=pprint - Data pretty printer - Python Documentation}}</ref>

A common [[neologism]] in the Python community is ''pythonic'', which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called ''unpythonic''.

Users and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as ''Pythonists'', ''Pythonistas'', and ''Pythoneers''.<ref name="AutoNT-27" /><ref name="AutoNT-25" />
