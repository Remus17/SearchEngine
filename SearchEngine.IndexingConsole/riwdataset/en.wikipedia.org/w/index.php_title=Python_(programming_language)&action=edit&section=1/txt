				You do not have permission to edit this page, for the following reasons:


Your IP address is in a range which has been blocked on all wikis.

The block was made by Vituzzu (meta.wikimedia.org).
The reason given is hosting service with open proxies such as 67.207.94.79 .

Start of block: 13:14, 23 October 2017
Expiration of block: 13:14, 23 October 2022

You can contact Vituzzu to discuss the block.
You cannot use the "Email this user" feature unless a valid email address is specified in your account preferences and you have not been blocked from using it.
Your current IP address is 67.207.88.228, and the blocked range is 67.207.64.0/19.
Please include all above details in any queries you make.


You are currently unable to edit Wikipedia.
You are still able to view pages, but you are not currently able to edit, move, or create them.




Editing from 67.207.64.0/19 has been blocked (disabled) by KrakatoaKatie for the following reason(s):




The IP address that you are currently using has been blocked  because it is believed to be a web host provider. To prevent abuse, web hosts may be blocked from editing Wikipedia.


You will not be able to edit Wikipedia using a web host provider.
Since the web host acts like a proxy, because it hides your IP address, it has been blocked. To prevent abuse, these IPs may be blocked from editing Wikipedia. If you do not have any other way to edit Wikipedia, you will need to request an IP block exemption.
If you do not believe you are using a web host, you may appeal this block by adding the following text on your talk page: {{unblock|reason=Caught by a web host block but this host or IP is not a web host. Place any further information here. ~~~~}}. If you are using a Wikipedia account you will need to request an IP block exemption by either using the unblock template or by submitting an appealing using the unblock ticket request system. If you wish to keep your IP address private you can email the functionaries team.
Administrators: The IP block exemption user right should only be applied to allow users to edit using web host in exceptional circumstances, and they should usually be directed to the functionaries team via email. If you intend to give the IPBE user right, a CheckUser needs to take a look at the account. This can be requested most easily at SPI Quick Checkuser Requests. Unblocking an IP or IP range with this template is highly discouraged without at least contacting the blocking administrator.

This block has been set to expire: 12:56, 12 August 2020.
Even if blocked, you will usually still be able to edit your user talk page and email other editors and administrators.

[[File:Guido van Rossum OSCON 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Guido van Rossum]], the creator of Python]]

{{Main article|History of Python}}

Python was conceived in the late 1980s,<ref name="venners-interview-pt-1" /> and its implementation began in December 1989<ref name="timeline-of-python" /> by [[Guido van Rossum]] at [[Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica]] (CWI) in the [[Netherlands]] as a successor to the [[ABC (programming language)|ABC language]] (itself inspired by [[SETL]])<ref name="AutoNT-12" /> capable of [[exception handling]] and interfacing with the [[Amoeba (operating system)|Amoeba]] operating system.<ref name="faq-created" /> Van Rossum remains Python's principal author. His continuing central role in Python's development is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community: ''[[Benevolent Dictator For Life]]'' (BDFL).

On the origins of Python, Van Rossum wrote in 1996:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.python.org/doc/essays/foreword/ |title=Foreword for "Programming Python" (1st ed.) |last=van Rossum |first=Guido |date=1996 |accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref>

{{quote|...In December 1989, I was looking for a "hobby" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of [[ABC (programming language)|ABC]] that would appeal to [[Unix]]/[[C (programming language)|C]] [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hackers]]. I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''). | Guido van Rossum}}

Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 and had many major new features, including a [[Cycle detection|cycle-detecting]] [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collector]] and support for [[Unicode]]. With this release, the development process became more transparent and community-backed.<ref name="newin-2.0" />

Python 3.0 (initially called Python 3000 or py3k) was released on 3 December 2008 after a long testing period. It is a major revision of the language that is not completely [[backward compatibility|backward-compatible]] with previous versions.<ref name="3.0-release" /> However, many of its major features have been [[backporting|backported]] to the Python 2.6.x<ref name="pep-3000" /> and 2.7.x version series, and releases of Python 3 include the <code>2to3</code> utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html |title=Automated Python 2 to 3 code translation — Python Documentation |accessdate=11 February 2018 }}</ref>

Python 2.7's [[end-of-life (product)|end-of-life]] date was initially set at 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/ |title=PEP 373 -- Python 2.7 Release Schedule |work=python.org |accessdate=9 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0466/ |title=PEP 466 -- Network Security Enhancements for Python 2.7.x |work=python.org |accessdate=9 January 2017}}</ref>

Python 3.6 had changes regarding [[UTF-8]] (in Windows, PEP 528 and PEP 529) and Python 3.7.0b1 ([https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0540/ PEP 540]) adds a new "UTF-8 Mode" (and overrides [[POSIX locale]]).

In January 2017, Google announced work on a Python 2.7 to [[Go (programming language)|Go]] [[transcompiler]] to improve performance under concurrent workloads.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/01/grumpy-go-running-python.html |title=Google Open Source Blog: Grumpy: Go running Python! |date=4 January 2017 |accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref>
