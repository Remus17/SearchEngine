				You do not have permission to edit this page, for the following reasons:


Your IP address is in a range which has been blocked on all wikis.

The block was made by Vituzzu (meta.wikimedia.org).
The reason given is hosting service with open proxies such as 67.207.94.79 .

Start of block: 13:14, 23 October 2017
Expiration of block: 13:14, 23 October 2022

You can contact Vituzzu to discuss the block.
You cannot use the "Email this user" feature unless a valid email address is specified in your account preferences and you have not been blocked from using it.
Your current IP address is 67.207.88.228, and the blocked range is 67.207.64.0/19.
Please include all above details in any queries you make.


You are currently unable to edit Wikipedia.
You are still able to view pages, but you are not currently able to edit, move, or create them.




Editing from 67.207.64.0/19 has been blocked (disabled) by KrakatoaKatie for the following reason(s):




The IP address that you are currently using has been blocked  because it is believed to be a web host provider. To prevent abuse, web hosts may be blocked from editing Wikipedia.


You will not be able to edit Wikipedia using a web host provider.
Since the web host acts like a proxy, because it hides your IP address, it has been blocked. To prevent abuse, these IPs may be blocked from editing Wikipedia. If you do not have any other way to edit Wikipedia, you will need to request an IP block exemption.
If you do not believe you are using a web host, you may appeal this block by adding the following text on your talk page: {{unblock|reason=Caught by a web host block but this host or IP is not a web host. Place any further information here. ~~~~}}. If you are using a Wikipedia account you will need to request an IP block exemption by either using the unblock template or by submitting an appealing using the unblock ticket request system. If you wish to keep your IP address private you can email the functionaries team.
Administrators: The IP block exemption user right should only be applied to allow users to edit using web host in exceptional circumstances, and they should usually be directed to the functionaries team via email. If you intend to give the IPBE user right, a CheckUser needs to take a look at the account. This can be requested most easily at SPI Quick Checkuser Requests. Unblocking an IP or IP range with this template is highly discouraged without at least contacting the blocking administrator.

: 
This block has been set to expire: 12:56, 12 August 2020.
Even if blocked, you will usually still be able to edit your user talk page and email other editors and administrators.

== Libraries ==
Python's large [[standard library]], commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths,<ref name="AutoNT-86" /> provides tools suited to many tasks. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as [[MIME]] and [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] are supported. It includes modules for creating [[graphical user interface]]s, connecting to [[relational database]]s, [[pseudorandom number generator|generating pseudorandom numbers]], arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals,<ref name="AutoNT-88" /> manipulating [[regular expression]]s, and [[unit testing]].

Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the [[Web Server Gateway Interface]] (WSGI) implementation <code>wsgiref</code> follows PEP 333<ref name="AutoNT-89" />), but most modules are not. They are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites (if supplied). However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations.

{{As of|2018|03|post=,}} the [[Python Package Index]] (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 130,000<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.modulecounts.com/ |title=Module Counts |date=|website=ModuleCounts |publisher=|last1=Debill|first1=Erik |accessdate=20 September 2017}}</ref> packages with a wide range of functionality, including:
