<h3>Extra Notes on Using Ninite With Kaseya</h3>

<p>Jim Lee wrote us with some more details on deploying Ninite installers via
Kaseya. He says:</p>

<p>Here is some information for Kaseya users when scripting. It seems that I
have to deploy Ninite packages as "user" accounts</p>

<p>(Though Rich Houk has notified us that things work fine running as SYSTEM
as long as the cache location has Everyone with Full Access permissions.
This is safe because Ninite verfies cached or downloaded files before
automating them.)</p>

<p>KASEYA INFO</p>

<p>To be a little more verbose in that explanation...</p>

<p>As was said, running as SYSTEM runs whatever tasks you perform in the
script as the local system account. Running as user will run it as the
logged in user unless you specify an "impersonate" command before that
(which is usually impersonating the specified administrator).</p>

<p>The real difference is that the SYSTEM account nearly always has full
rights to everything on that machine. A logged in user might not, though
impersonating the administrator usually will also have full rights to that
machine.</p>

<p>The SYSTEM account, though, knows nothing about network resources like
shared printers or shared folders on other computers. You can't, for
instance, have a SYSTEM account copy a file from a share on a server to a
local folder on that machine or run something located on a share on a
server.</p>

<p>The user accounts, however, might or might not have access to those
resources; if you run as the logged in user and that user doesn't have
rights to a particular share, your script won't, either.</p>

<p>Running as a logged-in user, though, gives you access to things in that
user's profile, home folder (if configured), etc. For instance, if you want
to change settings that are specific to that user (like changing the
desktop), you could easily do that within a script running as that user.
Another example is changing the registry in the HKCU hive (h_key current
user) which generally holds program and other settings that are particular
to that user (like last opened files, etc.).</p>

<p>Generally, though, I use an "impersonate administrator" command and then
run as user so that everything runs as the configured administrator. This
generally gives my scripts full access to everything on that computer and
everything on any network servers.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>I ran my script as "user" and silent and it worked perfectly. Seems as the
above explanation clears it up. "system" has NO network resources.</p>
